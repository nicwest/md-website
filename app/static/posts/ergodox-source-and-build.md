Ergodox keyboard, sourcing and building in Europe
=================================================

The [Ergodox keyboard](http://ergodox.org/) is one of the few options for people
looking for both a split,
[ergonomic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomic_keyboard) and [mechanical]()
keyboard. It's an open source design based on the [key64](http://www.key64.org/)
that aims to prevent [RSI](), while also offering things like programmable
firmware and [n-key-rollover]().
